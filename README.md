# command_parser
Example of a parser written in rust. It uses the pest-parser to deal with vim like keybindings and demonstrates the results with ncurses.

## Purpose of this project
Since the project [hexdino](https://github.com/Luz/hexdino) requires a more sophisticated logic than just some simple keybindings, this project should be a good base to simplify the code. It should be a nice playground.
